# Mult-game

## About

Mult-game is a little game made to help memorizing multiplication table.

It's pretty simple : once you started the game, it will ask you to solve a multiplication in less than 20 sec.
- If you succeed, it will increase your current streak. Every five successful answer, the max timer duration will decrease by 4 second to a limit of 4 second (to ensure you remembered the results). 
- If you fail, it's game over. You'll be able to register your score (using a 3 characters long nickname) and start over !.

The game is supposed to be able to update itself on launch.

More features are to come :

- [ ] live score display
- [ ] new difficulty mode (easier than the existing one)
- [ ] might add some other mod later
