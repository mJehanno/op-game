# Op-game

## About

Op-game is a little game made to help memorizing multiplication table and other basic operations.

There is a game mode for each basic operation (addition, substraction, multiplication, division)

Each mode comes with 3 difficulty level :
- easy -> you have 20 second to find the answer, no penalties
- medium -> you have 20 second to find the answer, each wrong answer will cost a life. You have 3 lives. Once lives are down to 0 it's **Game Over**
- hard -> you have 20 second to find the answer, each wrong answer is **Game Over**. Each streak of 5 good answer reduce the timer by 4second (to a minimum of 4seconds). The more you win the harder it becomes !

The game is supposed to be able to update itself on launch or you can download new versions [here](https://github.com/mJehanno/op-game/releases/).
